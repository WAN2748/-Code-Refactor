# Code Refractor
As requested I made modifactions to both the html and css files.
I addressed both files by making the html more descriptive and consolidated css for easier access.

## Changes Made: 

* html
  * made `tile` more specific by changing it to clients name
  * with in body made the div `header` 
  * in the `h1` element removed a span and class that had no declaration in css
  * the img under the header the div was changed to `figure` for the   background  img
  * made a `main` div
  * made a `article` div under `main`
  * made a `aside` div for side bar 
  * made `section` div under `aside`
  * img [./assets/images/cost*management.png] had a closing tag that was  removed
  * made `footer` div
  * changed the heart symbol to be read on all browsers

* css
  * all `header` declarations were changed from class to target element
  * `main` was changed to target element from class
  * `aside` was changed to target emement from class
  * consolidated repeditive declarations 
  * changed `footer` to target element 
  
## Help

* I used w3schools for proper semantic tags [https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp]

* Brian Adams and Takuya Matsumoto pointed out necessary changes in a homework discussion chat
